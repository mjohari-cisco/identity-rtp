Adding RDS RTP Plan

Author: Mayank Johari

This repository provides automation scripts and tools designed to enhance system resiliency by automating key resiliency tasks for Secure Access Identity Services (Control Plane). The goal is to reduce manual intervention, improve operational efficiency, and ensure consistent and reliable recovery processes. By leveraging automation, this project aims to streamline routine resiliency workflows such as failover management, recovery validation, and system monitoring, thereby minimizing downtime and accelerating response times during disruptions.

The automation framework integrates best practices in infrastructure as code (IaC), continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and event-driven automation to deliver scalable and repeatable resiliency operations. This approach helps organizations maintain high availability and service continuity by proactively managing and orchestrating resiliency tasks with minimal human error.
